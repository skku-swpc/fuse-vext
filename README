Fuse-ext2 is a EXT2 Filesystem support for FUSE.

This software is based on both ntfs-3g, and ext2fuse packages.


Project Name
------------
A Paravirtualized File System for Accelerating File I/O


Contribution
------------
This file system is a paravirtualized file system based on fuse-ext2 
for improving I/O performance of the virtualized systems.
A major role of this file system is to bypass guest I/O stack. 
When an application requests file I/O, a paravirtualized file system passes the I/O request 
to the host instead of the block layer of guest kernel, and waits for completion. 
After the request is processed in the host, the file system takes the result and acts the same 
as if it was handled in the guestâ€™s block layer. 
A file system is the first step of handling a file I/O requested from user applications. 
If I/O requests are passed to the host at this point, the rest of the guest I/O stack can be bypassed. 
Compared to the I/O process in a non-virtualized system, duplicated I/O stacks are 
one major cause of degrading performance in a virtual machine. 
Especially, in case the virtual machine utilizes image files as block devices, 
merging and sorting operations of an I/O scheduler may give negative effects to the I/O process in the host. 
It is because the consecutive disk blocks from a viewpoint of the guest are no longer consecutive in the host. 
It depends on the file system type of both the host and the guest as well as the format of the disk image file. 
Consequently, eliminating a redundant I/O stack on the guest side can improve file I/O performance.


Dependencies
------------

  Fuse-ext2 requires at least Fuse version 2.6.0 for linux, for max os latest
version of macfuse would be fine (2.0.3).

- Linux:
	Fuse from http://fuse.sourceforge.net/

- Mac OS:
	Mac Fuse from http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/


Build
-----	

- Linux:
	$ ./autogen.sh
	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ sudo make install

	You can use checkinstall or some other equivalent tool to generate install
	package for your distribution.

- Mac OS:
	Standart build:
	$ ./autogen.sh
	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ sudo make install

	Universal build:
	$ ./autogen.sh
	$ CFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch ppc" ./configure --disable-dependency-tracking
	$ make
	$ sudo make install
	
	Tiger (Universal) build:
	$ export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET="10.4"
	$ export OSX_SDK="/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk"
	$ export OSX_CFLAGS="-isysroot $OSX_SDK -arch ppc -arch i386"
	$ export OSX_LDFLAGS="-Wl,-syslibroot,$OSX_SDK -arch ppc -arch i386"
	$ ./autogen.sh
	$ CFLAGS="$OSX_CFLAGS" CXXFLAGS="$OSX_CFLAGS" LDFLAGS="$OSX_LDFLAGS" ./configure --disable-dependency-tracking
	$ make
	$ sudo make install
	
	Generating package:
	$ make package

Usage
-----

Usage:    fuse-ext2 <device|image_file> <mount_point> [-o option[,...]]

Options:  ro, force, allow_others
          Please see details in the manual.

Example:  fuse-ext2 /dev/sda1 /mnt/sda1

Bugs
----

there are no known bugs for read-only mode, read only mode should be ok for every one.

altough, write support is available (and it is pretty stable) please do not mount your
filesystems with write support unless you do not have anything to loose.

please send output the output of below command while reporting bugs.

$ /usr/local/bin/fuse-ext2 -v /dev/path /mnt/point -o debug

Labels
------

please do not use comma ',' in partition labels.

wrong: e2label /dev/disk0s3 "linux,ext3"

correct: e2label /dev/disk0s3 "linux-ext3"
